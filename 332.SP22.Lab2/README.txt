Errors:

-I had a "vector subscript out of range" which was solved by fully populating the gameboard vector with empty game pieces, then adding the real pieces.

-my print gameboard function was printing checkers wrong, this was solved by adding a space after the cout in the ftn

error LNK1104 was very annoying since it wasnt an issue with code and had several complicated potential fixes on the internet. ended up being pretty simple, I just logging out and back onto the remote desktop.

many many other errors and literal 15-20 hrs of coding/debuging
